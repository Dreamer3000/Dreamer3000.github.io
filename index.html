            <div class = "about">
                <p> Synthetic Biology is an interdisciplinery field between clasical biology and engineering, aiming to
                    tackle many problems humanity faces in the modern world. The applications range from hardier crops
                    to gene editing to grant immunity to the worst diseases that plague our species. This is a club
                    focused on introducing this growing field and all its components to students in a more casual setting 
                    with presentations, demonstrations and activities. Meeting topics focus on anything from 3D printing to 
                    how animals handle low temperatures safely and reliably. Stop by to learn something new, chill out and
